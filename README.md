# Digital Rakhi for Sweety Akka ðŸ’–

This website is a heartfelt tribute to my dearest sister, **Sweety Akka**, who is currently living in Canada.  
For the first time since our childhood, we are celebrating **Raksha Bandhan** miles apart, and I wanted to create something special to bridge the distance.

This project is more than just a website â€” itâ€™s a **digital Rakhi**, woven with memories, love, and the unbreakable bond we share.  
Every word, image, and detail here reflects how much she means to me and how deeply I miss our yearly traditions.

Through this platform, Iâ€™ve:
- Captured our cherished memories  
- Shared my feelings and gratitude  
- Celebrated the beautiful bond between a brother and sister  

ðŸ’Œ **Message:** Even if oceans separate us, love knows no borders. This is my way of sending a Rakhi across the world.
